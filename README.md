2. Namespace
In .NET, a namespace is a way to organize classes and other types, helping to avoid naming conflicts and group related functionalities.
Key Features:
•	Syntax: namespace MyNamespace { /* types */ }
•	Purpose:
o	Organize code logically.
o	Prevent naming collisions between classes.
•	Common .NET Namespaces:
o	System: Core types like String, Array, and Console.
o	System.Collections.Generic: Collection types such as List<T> and Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.
o	System.Linq: Language Integrated Query features.
o	System.Threading: Multithreading and asynchronous operations.
Custom Namespace Example:
namespace MyProject
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    }
}
